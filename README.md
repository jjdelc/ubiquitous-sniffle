# Color app

A friend showed me about thie "App he downloaded" to use different color lights on his phone screen. To which I screamed, "You don't need to download an app for that!".

So, here's this website that does just that, you can "install" it as a web app on your phone screen so it will be essentially the same.

PS: Gave it a shot using the default repo name suggestion from Github.
